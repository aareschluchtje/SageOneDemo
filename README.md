Sample application that integrates with Sage One Accounting via the Sage One API.

Update the Sage One Authorisation Client solution's [SageOneOAuth.cs](Sage%20One%20Authorisation%20Client/SageOneOAuth.cs) file with your application's `callback_url`, `client_id`, `client_secret` and `signing_secret`.

Authentication with Sage One is handled in [SageOneOAuth.cs](Sage%20One%20Authorisation%20Client/SageOneOAuth.cs).

An example application that consumes the client can be seen in the Sage One API sample Website Solution.
